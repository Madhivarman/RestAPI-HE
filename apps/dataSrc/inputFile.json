Within two days, it started giving me issue with network & WiFi connectivity. I again contacted Amazon through app but i was directed to Apple support. After talking to Apple representative, i only got indefinite answer like it could be software issue and i should wait till it updates but Amazon return\/replace policy valid for only 10 days. After purchasing a phone worth up to 90k, i had to do all this and still no support from Amazon.\"",

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldnt go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.\", Pros:, - I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy., \"- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didnt feel it was worth the extra 30K.\", - Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12., \"- The Camera is a beauty. You cant compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.\", \"- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesnt even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.\", Cons:, - The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later., - The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector, - Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly., - Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max., \"- The battery isnt the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.\", - With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.",

    "Desc": "Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine., iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!, Pros:, 1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it, 2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking, 3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901., Cons:, 1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!), 2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8., 3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking option, Will come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.",

I think Apple IS the best. Looks, functionality and everything. It does test the depth of your pockets and I think thats the only mark that there is and therefore it doesnt need comparing with other nondescript ones. I have never had any complains with any of my iphones in the past. This is my fourth upgrade. As a girl , it fulfils on the following categories - Good looks, Good looks & Good Looks. So grateful to Apple. So grateful to Amazon & so grateful to the seller. Thank you.\"",

It will take you some time to explore the features as it is much different from Android but its fun.

    "Desc": "Apple has always been a coin with 2 sides, it has loyal followers who will swear by it and it has loyal critics who will feed of it. Now coming to the iPhone X. I will be speaking only about the phone and it\u2019s features and not compare with other models., Pros-, - Its  truly a beautiful phone. The notch in the top is something I feel u will want to have once u start using it., - the build quality is amazing. It\u2019s a premium phone from the get go. Once u open the box, it\u2019s like opening a Pandora\u2019s box, something truly befitting a flagship.(of course it\u2019s an year old now), - the screen resolution is just crisp and jaw dropping. Unlike its predecessors, the screen is gorgeous. Colours are spot on, the True Tone display needs some time to get used to but later there\u2019s no turning back to the normal mode. The colours, no matter the time of the day, sunlight , no light, moonlight, tube light or what ever, always great., -the camera is very good being a dual camera and all and the pictures are pretty good, although I am not a avid mobile photographer., -the size of the phone is just right. At least for me it seems a good fit. Although sometimes 2 hands are required for some tasks but overall one handed most of the time., - Face ID- this is where it gets tricky. The phone unlocks with Face ID or a passcode. Now I have tried this feature with a beard , dim lighting , night times and many possible scenarios, and I must say , it\u2019s good. Although it\u2019s takes a few milliseconds more in low lighting, but over all good. (PS NOTE- there is no finger print unlock !!!!!!!), - The phone is truly fast. Multitasking, heavy gaming, anything is like a walk in the park for the phone. It\u2019s truly a beast with it processing speed. Doesn\u2019t warm up even when doing multiple tasks or playing PUBG. You have to understand that apple uses its RAM in a different way, so 3gb RAM may seem little on paper but don\u2019t let numbers fool you., Cons-, - battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage I feel is a bit disappointing. Could have been better, but hey, that\u2019s what power banks are there for., - headphone jack- this is truly frustrating sometimes!!!! I mean come on!!!!! Who will manufacture Bose or sony  or beats headphones with a lighting cable!!!!!!!! U will have to carry the connector all the time or leave it attached to ur headphones all the time to avoid forgetting them in a hurry., These are just a few points I have noticed after using the phone for sometime, will update if I feel anything is needed.",

The battery life is quite good as well. With heavy use it\u2019s been able to last more than 12-14 hours., No heating issues., Supports siri and amazon alexa as well out of the box., Though it is a very slippery phone so first don\u2019t forget to get a heavy phone cover., Only if you use you will realise why this phone is expensive and as always nothing comes closer to apples interface.",

In real life usage, I didnt find the phone to lag anytime and feels fast, smooth and very responsive. The display is great as expected from an AMOLED and I noticed an increase in the battery life as well.\", iPhones typically, should be treated as an investment and not a product to show off. I am a power user and this serves all my needs very well. I am pretty sure that Apple will continue to support this product for quite a few years down the line as well therefore, went for the iPhone X instead of the iPhone XS.",

If we are paying such a high amount for these phones then they should not have these kinds of problems. Now amazon is not providing me with an option to get replacement but instead I have to go at apple service centre and submit my phone with them for 3-4 days. Until then no phone or a standby phone from apple. This is a very poor experience as I will have to go through all the hassle. Other than that the delivery was on time.",

Apple really needs to understand, that if you will keep on increasing rates the way you are doing, no one will care about getting them anymore.",

I have verified this product with apple support As well as on apple website.Received 100 % genuine product. There is no much difference in iPhone 7 and 8 and similarly in iPhone X and XS so upgrading to iPhone X in same cost of IPhone 8 Plus and considerably less price than iPhone XS make sense., I like the full Screen display, Camera and design of this product. Battery life is also improved than iPhone 7. It is fast and Overall performance is also good., But it is little heavier than its predecessors., And it is delicate. Phone grip is slippery due to back panel smooth finishing. Use good quality (Spigen, Viva Madrid) back cover for protection and good grip., Thanks Amazon for offering huge discount on this premium phone.",

    "Title": "One Year later. Real review, No fluff., .",
    "Desc": "This phone carries with itself great hype and consequently great expectations. In my experience, having had both the 8 plus and this, the main perceivable differences between both are in the size, the edge to edge display, front camera portrait mode, the absence of the home button, the new UI gestures and of course FaceID. How well are these implemented?, \u2022 UI gestures- The new way of navigation is very well implemented and I have not experienced any difficulties in adapting to or using them The swipe up gesture to go home, swipe right and hold for multitasking etc are really easy and intuitive. People have been complaining about the control centre now a swipe down from the top right corner. But I ask how is this different from the notifications and quick toggle on Android which is also a swipe down from the top? With the new breed of 18:9 screen aspect ratio Android phones which are taller than ever before, this gesture is none the easier. I give it a score of 7.5\/10, \u2022 FaceID- Works like a charm. The sensors are very forgiving of the angle but it won\u2019t work if you\u2019re holding your phone upside down or sideways. Apart from that, it works very well. It has a wide range of view. You don\u2019t have to be dead centre in front of the phone for it to unlock. Works with sunglasses and spectacles and has no problem either in pitch dark or bright sunlight as long as the sun is not on your face or behind you. Prospective buyers shouldn\u2019t have any apprehensions regarding it. Apple has given us a very good alternative to TouchID. It scores 8\/10, \u2022 Front camera portrait- Nothing special. You have to try several times for it to give an acceptable result. Doesn\u2019t compare well with the Pixel 2 phones. Yet, the skin tones on the iPhone are always far more natural than its Android counterparts. Doesn\u2019t deserve more than 6\/10, \u2022 OLED Display- You really have to look for differences between the IPS LCD of the 8 plus and the X. Apple does such a good job with the calibration of their displays that, frankly, I don\u2019t see much difference in the quality of colours between the OLED iPhone X and the LCD 8 plus. Yes the OLED has more contrast compared to the LCD but if you\u2019re looking to buy a phone purely for the punchy saturation and vividness of an OLED display, this is not it. You\u2019d do well to look at the Samsung Note8. Apple always favours colour accuracy over vividness. The display quality deserves an 8\/10, \u2022 Battery life is better than the 8 but worse than the 8 plus. There\u2019s no competition. If you\u2019re a heavy user, you will not get a full day\u2019s use out of it. Plus, charging it is even slower than the 8 plus as the battery is actually bigger in size. Wireless charging is on board but is very slow in my experience. I have the Samsung fast charger that comes with the Note8 and use it to charge this phone. The battery scores 6\/10., \u2022 Animoji- Fun if you spend too much time messaging people on iMessage. The novelty of it will wear off. The problem is that Apple has made us think it is some futuristic cutting edge tech built into its TrueDepth sensors when it actually isn\u2019t. It is just using the front camera for face tracking and there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be ported over to the 8 or older iPhones. But we know that is never going to happen. Apple will keep updating new characters to keep Animoji interesting. I give it a 5\/10 because it is marketed as something which it isn\u2019t., MY SCORE - 6.75\/10, \u2022 FAQs-, 1- How is the size and in-hand feel?-  The size of the phone is much more manageable in one hand. The screen is narrower and gives less screen space than the plus model. It feels solid and premium in the hand. No creaking sounds yet., 2- How bad is \"The Notch\"? - Doesn\u2019t bother me anywhere outside Youtube videos or other video streaming platforms. It does cut into the video if you decide to expand the video to make full use of the available screen. It\u2019s not noticeable in general usage like browsing, social media or messaging., CONCLUDING THOUGHTS- In my experience, one has to look at both the iPhone 8\/8plus and the iPhone X in isolation to fully appreciate them. If one spends time comparing them, they\u2019re bound to feel frustrated as there are far too many similarities to justify the huge price difference. If you\u2019re someone who must have the shiniest offering from Apple, then the X is for you. But, if you want bang for your buck, then go for the 8 plus, as it is pound for pound the better phone between the two. The differences are simply not enough to justify spending extra. The camera performance, processor, RAM, storage options, apps, software features are the same and the X doesn\u2019t offer as many extras that make it stand apart from its sibling. Maybe next year, Apple?, \"IS IT WORTH IT?- There won\u2019t be a cop out here. If youre contemplating between this and the 8 plus, in my opinion, to buy this phone, this year, at this price, is not worth it. (My purchase price was 87.5k). Even if you can afford it, or have an iPhone above the 6s\/Plus, you can skip it without much remorse. iPhone 7\/7 plus are still great phones and if you can hold off another year, then the 2018 lineup of iPhones is shaping up to be pretty exciting. Compared to the iPhone 8 plus, all the features this phone offers either looked at in isolation or even as a whole, do not justify getting it. Going forward, all iPhones are going to be designed like this and improve upon it. It\u2019s not a limited edition model which is a must have.\", \"If this is going to be your first iPhone or if youre looking to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s, go ahead. It is a great phone and you wont regret getting it.\", I have put photos of the phone here. For the camera samples, please see my iPhone 8 plus review as there is no difference in photo quality between the two. Here is the link--- https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/gp\/review\/R6DSET4ETOTXH\/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8, X vs XS- The hardware upgrades between the X and XS are as follows-, The speakers are slightly better, the camera records video in stereo mode, the water resistance rating has improved from IP67 to IP68, there is 4GB RAM now, the bokeh is adjustable in the portrait shots, Smart HDR takes multi frame pics like the Pixel 2, photos have much improved dynamic range and there\u2019s a new gold colour. Apart from the camera improvements, there is not much that markedly improve your experience if you\u2019ve been using the X the past year. Apple knows this too and have positioned the XS and XS Max as upgrades for people using older iPhones. (6, 6s, 7, 8) If you\u2019re using any of these phones, the upgrade makes sense. iPhone X users are better off waiting till next year., Price update as on October 9, 2018- Since the 64GB iPhone X is now available at 69,990\/- on Amazon, it is a better deal and worth considering for all those who have waited all this while and stayed away from the X due to the high price tag.",

Wish they couldve provided same mechanism like delete conversation or other messages i.e. left swipe\", 5. Could not clear all notifications in one go. Right cross button to clear all appears after a while, 6. Waiting for official wireless charger as could not find reliable reviews for other brand chargers, \"Im using Mac for around 4 years now and there is no software glitch Ive observed. The purpose of getting iPhone was to get similar reliable OS and software performance which might take some time for Android to catch up and Im highly satisfied till now.\"",

    "Desc": "I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction., The transition:, \"NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, its all so easy. Now, this isnt to say there isnt a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).\", Face ID:, \"I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As Ive adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and its not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, its unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint\/passcode.\", \"Its important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gathers and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).\", What I love:, - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black)., \"- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think its iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.\", \"- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you havent seen one, check one out at a local store.\", \"- Im not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.\", - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way., - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera., - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening., - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it., \"What I dont:\", Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",

    "Title": "Great Phone But, .",
    "Desc": "Is it a good phone ? Yes. Is it the best? Well, No., \"Lets break it down into pros and cons and discuss whats in the package.\", Pros:-, 1. It is one of the most powerful smartphone in the market. Apple has done a great job coming up with A11 bionic chip which is on par with snapdragon 845 chip that came significantly later. A11 chip coupled with greatly optimized IOS makes this phone faster than almost 95% smartphones available. The faceid with ir dot projection is most secure than any other., 2. The latest released iOS 11 comes packed with features and is faster than ever. It has the most simplistic and natural user interface on a smartphone., 3. It has currently the 3rd best camera present on any smartphone out there after the samsung galaxy s9+ and HUawei p20 pro. But unlike the first two, it provides more details,similar quality in a smaller image size meaning it takes up less storage space., 4. I am just in love with the design of this phone. The phone is just gorgeous, i mean just beautiful. Depending on who you ask, the notch is debatable but i dont mind it because it giver more screen space. But with more and more phones coming with the notch, you just have to accept that its going to stay., 5. The biggest selling point of apple devices is the after sales service that apple provides, being it software updates, hardware issues or just any customer support whatsoever. Apple service is best in class and nobody can argue that., 6. Another aspect of apple devices is the ecosystem that apple has created, every apple device you own is connected to each other all the time. This feature is really convenient and you get all your notifications at all your device, you can continue anything on each of your devices where you left it., Cons:-, \"1.Lets face the biggest let down of this phone, the price which is even more increased here in india. US price is 1000 $ and its indian price converted into dollars sums upto 1500$ which is absurd. Considering all the benefits, it is still too high which kind of overshadows everything else.\", 2. Unlocking the phone with faceid is a two step process which annoying and slow as compared to other phones., Conclusion:- All in all it is a great phone, if it was available between a price bracket of 65-70k rupees. It could have been a great purchase.",

It quality and condition is good. I really loved it. Below are some features and brief description about it., BRIEF DESCRIPTION:-, Design and Display, How do you create a deeply intelligent device whose enclosure and display are a single, uninterrupted element? That\u2019s the goal we first set for ourselves with the original iPhone. With iPhone X, we\u2019ve achieved it., With iPhone X, the device is the display. An all\u2011new 5.8\u2011inch Super Retina screen fills the hand and dazzles the eyes., The display employs new techniques and technology to precisely follow the curves of the design, all the way to the elegantly rounded corners., Front and Back Glass, The front and back are all glass - the most durable we\u2019ve ever made, with a strengthening layer that\u2019s 50% deeper. A seven-layer ink process allows for precise hues and opacity, and a reflective optical layer enhances the colors. And an oleophobic coating lets you easily wipe off smudges and fingerprints., Wireless Charging for a Wireless World, We\u2019ve always intended iPhone to be a truly wireless device, free from charging cables and headphone cords. With a glass back and an embedded wireless charging system, iPhone X is designed for a wireless future., Water and Dust Resistance, iPhone X is precision-engineered at the microscopic level to protect against water, splashes, and dust., OLED Designed for iPhone X, The first OLED screen that rises to the standards of iPhone, with accurate, stunning colors, true blacks, high brightness, and a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio, Improved Cameras, A larger and faster 12MP sensor. A new color filter. Deeper pixels. And a new telephoto camera with OIS., The wide-angle and telephoto cameras on iPhone X enable optical zoom, as well as digital zoom of up to 10x for photos and 6x for videos., Face ID, Face ID is enabled by the TrueDepth camera and is simple to set up. It projects and analyzes more than 30,000 invisible dots to create a precise depth map of your face., So Much Technology. In So Little Space, The TrueDepth camera system allows you to take amazing photos and enables Face ID. It\u2019s housed in a tiny space at the top of the display, yet within this miniaturized module are some of the most advanced technologies we\u2019ve ever developed., FEATURES:-, 1) 14.73 centimeters (5.8-inch) capacitive touchscreen with 2436 x 1125 pixels resolution, 2) iOS v11.1.1 operating system with 1.3GHz Apple A11 Bionic hexa core processor, 3GB RAM, 64GB internal memory and single SIM, 3) 2716mAH lithium-ion battery, 4) 1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase, SO IF THIS REVIEW HELPED PLEASE VOTE IT HELPFUL.",

    "Desc": "I have recently ordered iPhone for my cousin and you can find below my review on the product based on a weeks usage. I will update this again after a month of use. Personally i have been a iPhone user for a long time now and yes i use Android phones also, because i am an app developer., iPhone X Pros, - Size and design, iPhone X is an unbelievably designed device, that feels so sleek and handy. It is slightly larger than iPhone 8 but smaller than iPhone 8 S. I have attached images taken from Apple store for comparison., - Camera - It has the best ever camera on an iPhone. I said on iPhone, because there are devices like Pixel 2, Mi 8 , Huawei P20 Pro that comes with half the price of iPhone x and better camera., - Shooting videos - I have always noticed that iPhone offers an edge in video quality over other phones of similar specs, - Waterproof - iPhone X is rated IP67. A lot of people lose their phones due to water damage. Sometimes, an iphone can save you from buying a new phone, which is a kind of cost saving. Especially if you spend a lot of time in pool, outdoor activities this might be a boon. Also you can shoot a lot of underground videos., Cons, \"- Costly, yes iPhone X comes at a very premium price. Its a phone made for high class category only\", - If you are looking for best camera phone, go for something else. You can get a Pixel 2, Mi8 , or P20 for less than half price. These phones have better Dxomark scores than iPhoneX. Head on to Dxo Mark website and check., Being an iPhone user for a long time, i would also like to list a few cons and pros of using iPhone compared to Android, iPhone Pros,  - If you have a mac, iPhone can work seamlessly with mac. The same apps are available for mac and iPhone which syncs seamlessly. Calendar, TODOs, Notes, Contacts etc helps me a lot. I add a todo from my mac and next moment i have it on my phone too. That works great., - If you are someone who is hooked up to mac always, you can easily attend your calls on mac ig both devices are on same network. I have found this really helpful, - Apple makes the best non bud type earphones in my experience. Personally i do not like in ear canal earphones as they can impair hearing. I have found no other good alternatives to Apple earphones in terms of audio clarity. But yes you can get better over the ear or in canal earphones., - Physical button for silent mode - Yes, thats a quick and comfy shortcut to turn your phone silent even without unlocking it\/turning screen on. If you are a person who attends a lot of meetings and requires to turn phone silent, this can be quite helpful. You can quickly check the button position and say your phone is silent or not., iPhone Cons, \"-  Accessories are costly - If you need to buy an extra cable(maybe for office) or adapter, you need to shell somewhere between 1500 to 2500 bucks. Chinese accessories wont work well and perfect with iPhone\", - iOS is buggy at times. I have to admit that. Not just that, apple bug fixing is very slow compared to Googles Android, -  Apple music is slighly costly comapred to Google music - 120 rs per month, If you are looking for cheaper alternatives, i would suggest you the Google Pixel 2. Google pixel comes with Unlimited Original quality photo and video storage. On iPhone, for the same thing you have to shell out additional 75INR per month for 50 GB. For higher storage you need to pay more. If you are a person who shoots a lot of videos, Googles Unlimited storage can save you a lot of money. However you can install Google photos and get Unlimited Normal backup for photos and videos on any iOS\/Android phone, where Google converts the files to reduce quality. For images, its quite ok, the difference is barely noticeable, but for videos yes , they convert it to One-fourth the size.",

    "Title": "From a 6S to an X - A wonderful, luxury, phone., .",
    "Desc": "I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction., The transition:, \"NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, its all so easy. Now, this isnt to say there isnt a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).\", Face ID:, \"I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As Ive adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and its not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, its unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint\/passcode.\", \"Its important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gathers and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).\", The price:, \"There seems to be this running idea that a Rs.89,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phones are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didnt buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly Rs. 10,000 a month on EMI for 9 months. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was Rs.70,000. Yes, theres a price difference, but my point is that its not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and be utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apples flagship and there are cheaper iPhones out there.\", What I love:, - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black)., \"- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think its iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.\", \"- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you havent seen one, check one out at a local store.\", \"- Im not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.\", - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way., - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera., - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening., - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it., \"What I dont:\", Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",

The colors are also very good., The FaceID works perfectly.

    "Desc": "Update on 27-Dec-2017\u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f, This is my 6th week using iPhone X 64GB, I bought  space grey colour which I felt much more elegant than the Silver. This is my upgradation from iPhone 6s to X., Below sharing my experience:-, \u2022 The first attraction was bezel less phone. The screen size is 5.8 inch which is bigger than iPhone 8 plus (5.7\u201d). However, the physical dimension of the phone is slightly bigger than my iPhone 6s., \u2022 The second attraction was Face ID, I was little bit hesitant in the beginning after going through so many online reviews. But I would say this is one of the techno marvellous thing done by Apple. Some of the key highlights of the Face ID:-, - The ring volume diminishes immediately after it detects your face with the moment you look into the phone. The action is immediate., - You can set up more robust way to detect your Face ID under the settings of \u201cFace ID & Pass Code\u201d menu., - It works in low light, not an issue at all., - Although it hangs rarely as the same way legacy iPhone home button. In that case, need to use pass code., \u2022 Missing of Home button : There should not be any worry for this, It is more convenient without this, simply taping on the screen makes screen lit, and then need not hovering around for correctly pressing of the home button., \u2022 The camera is just extraordinary, the low light performance and true colour capture is supreme experience. I have attached two photos; one photo taken in the night in highway. Other is day light photo. Both are not processed., \u2022 Video : It is reported in other reviews that this iPhone series has only the capability of taking 60fps at 4K colour which stands the most capable phone camera for video., \u2022 Single handed operation : It is still possible easily. Please do a search in the net for how to do this., \u2022 Price : I don\u2019t deny the fact that 89K rupees for 64GB is little pricy, it should have loaded 128 GB at least. However, I purchased this as combo offer with watch series 3 through one of the leading credit card offer. So, please watch out for some good deal if you really bother with the price., \u2022 Battery life : I found longer battery life than the iPhone 6s besides bigger screen size. I am high user of the phone with always data and Bluetooth on because using watch as well. It last almost full day., \u2022 Speed : It responds very fast not an issue at all., \u2022 Wireless charging: I am yet to check this properly, I tried in my 1A Qi charger it doesn\u2019t work, you need 2A rating Qi charger, \u2022 Speaker Quality : It is very loud and crisp., \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f CONS:-, I find only one issue as of now i.e., charging time, \u2022 Charging time : It takes around 2 hours to charge fully from 10% level to 100%, My final verdict: If you are looking for bezel free phone with decent battery life and superior camera, just go for this phone.",

    "Title": "Apple shoppers face a tough choice between this phone and the iPhone 8, .",
    "Desc": "The iPhone X is an innovative device with a fantastic camera and beautiful display, but other phones are tougher and can operate longer on a charge., Those are among the conclusions we\u2019ve reached after completing testing on Apple\u2019s new flagship model, which starts at $1,000 for the 64-gigabyte version., Overall, the iPhone X\u2014as in 10, not the letter that follows W\u2014easily made Consumer Reports\u2019 recommended list and broke into the extremely tight list of top 10 rated phones, where all the devices are separated by only two points on our 100-point scale., It was edged out by Apple\u2019s less-expensive iPhone 8, starting at $700, and 8 Plus, starting at $800, which both proved hardier in a test designed to reproduce the drops and fumbles that can cause cracked screens and other damage., \u201cIf not for the damage in that durability test, the iPhone X would have come in ahead of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,\u201d says Richard Fisco, head of smartphone testing at CR., Given how close the scores of all the phones in our top 10 are, it\u2019s not really a question of which phone is best but which is the best fit for you., If you\u2019re choosing among the new crop of iPhones, one of the most obvious differences is the lack of a Home button on the iPhone X and the advent of Face ID for unlocking the phone (more on that below)., Additionally, the iPhone X has the biggest screen of the three\u20145.8 inches, measured diagonally, compared with 5.5 inches for the iPhone 8 Plus and 4.7 inches for the 8. But that expansive display comes in a tight package: The iPhone X is just a smidge taller than the iPhone 8 at 5.6 inches, and more than a half-inch shorter than the iPhone 8 Plus., Here\u2019s a closer look at our test results and how the iPhone X compares with other top-rated phones on the market., \"The iPhone Xs Strengths\", Beautiful Display, The iPhone X features Apple\u2019s first OLED phone screen. The technology, already used by smartphone manufacturers such as LG and Samsung and found in some high-end TVs, can produce very deep black tones and unlimited viewing angles. (That means the image doesn\u2019t noticeably degrade when you view the screen from the side.), Our testers gave the phone\u2019s display excellent marks, pointing to its overall brightness and vibrant colors, along with the deep black levels., We think that Apple shoppers who put the iPhone X side by side with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will notice a significant difference, although these phones have very good screens as well., Outstanding Cameras, The rear camera on the iPhone X is among the best we\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, if you combine the performance scores for stills and video, this is the highest-rated smartphone camera Consumer Reports has tested., Like the 7 Plus and 8 Plus, the iPhone X has a second, 2X zoom camera on the back of the phone. But unlike those other iPhones, both of the iPhone X\u2019s backside cameras have optical image stabilization, which steadies the lenses to offset the effects of shaky hands. (The 7 Plus and 8 Plus have that feature on only one camera lens.), This setup produced impressive results when testers compared photos using the zoom to those shot using the zoom lenses of earlier iPhone Plus models. Stills taken with the iPhone X were sharp, with excellent color reproduction, and video was very sharp as well., Convenient Face ID, Much has been made of Apple\u2019s decision to do away with the Home button on the iPhone X. That opened up screen real estate, but when the Home button disappeared, the embedded fingerprint sensor went with it, and Apple now relies upon a new biometric feature for authenticating users. Called Face ID, the technology maps your features and lets you unlock the phone simply by taking a look at the screen. (You can also type in a PIN.), We found the setup and unlocking process to be both quick and easy. The technology worked when we held the phone at all but the most severe angles and did not falter when used by testers with a wide range of skin tones, even when they put on reading glasses. You need to look directly at the screen to prompt it to unlock, making it less likely that you\u2019ll unlock the device inadvertently., The removal of the Home button requires you to learn a series of new swipe and button commands to operate the phone. This takes a little getting used to. But our testers picked up on the new gestures quickly and were satisfied with the phone\u2019s overall usability., \"The iPhone Xs Shortcomings\", Broken Glass, In our initial drop test, the iPhone X performed just fine. It survived four falls onto a concrete surface from a height of 5 feet. For that quick test, we used our custom-designed Drop Tower and let the phone fall on its front, back, and two different corners., However, iPhone X phones didn\u2019t fare nearly as well when subjected to a more intensive lab test in a tumbling machine. The tumbler is a rotating chamber that repeatedly drops a phone from a height of about 2.5 feet. The phones are checked for damage after 50 drops and then again after 100., The goal of all that repetition is to expose the phone to impacts from a wide variety of angles., We tumbled three samples of the iPhone X. The first was fine after 50 drops, but the glass on the back was significantly cracked after 100. The other two phones ended up with malfunctioning displays after 50 drops. Though the front glass didn\u2019t crack, several bright green bars stretched across the screens from top to bottom., The iPhone X isn\u2019t the first phone to fail our tumble test. For example, our testers also reported broken displays and back panels when they tumbled Samsung\u2019s nearly all-glass Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones., In light of those results, we recommend that you protect any of these phones in a case., Responding to our findings, Apple affirmed the iPhone X\\s durability based on the company\\s \"rigorous real world testing\" and said that the phone \"is made from the most durable glass ever in a smartphone.\", Durability is something to think about if you\u2019re considering a purchase of the iPhone X. The phone isn\u2019t just expensive to buy; it\u2019s also unusually pricey to repair. For example, the Apple Store will charge you $279 to fix the display and $549 to fix any other part of the phone, including its glass back. (This could make it worthwhile for some consumers to shell out for AppleCare+ coverage, which costs $199.), Tumble tests don\u2019t get a lot of weight when we calculate a phone\u2019s Overall Score. However, these results combined with the iPhone X\u2019s comparatively low battery-life showing (see below) did knock the phone down a few spots in our rankings, says Fisco, who leads CR\u2019s phone testing program., On the flip side, the iPhone X aced our water-resistance testing, surviving for 30 minutes at a depth of about 3 feet, just as Apple promises in its specs. The phone was examined right afterward, as well as one, two, and three days later, and continued to work., This is consistent with the results for other recent Apple phones, including the 7- and 8-series iPhones, which also did well in our water-immersion tests., Short Battery Life, The iPhone X\u2019s battery life hurt the phone\u2019s Overall Score in Consumer Reports testing., To find out exactly how long a phone\u2019s battery can go, Consumer Reports uses a robotic finger programmed to put the phone through a range of tasks designed to simulate a consumer\u2019s average day., The robot browses the internet, takes pictures, uses GPS navigation, and, of course, makes phone calls. We run all smartphone battery tests with the display set to 100 percent brightness. If you use any phone\u2019s auto, or adaptive, brightness, the battery should last longer., In our testing, the iPhone X\u2019s battery lasted 19.5 hours. That\u2019s just ahead of the 19 hours logged by the iPhone 8 and the considerably smaller iPhone SE but below the 21 hours recorded by the 8 Plus\u2014and it\u2019s far less than the 26 hours that Samsung\u2019s S8 and S8+ delivered. (Some other smartphones in our ratings run even longer on a charge.), While for many people 19.5 hours is enough to get them through the day, it\u2019s still shorter than the majority of the 38 smartphones we recommend., According to Apple, the iPhone X\u2019s A11 Bionic chip is designed to manage the device\u2019s power supply intelligently, balancing the demands for speed and energy in a way that permits you to complete the tasks you perform most often\u2014think texting or web browsing\u2014with optimal efficiency., When you combine that with the model\u2019s custom battery design, the company says, the iPhone X should last \u201cup to 2 hours longer between charges than the iPhone 7.\u201d In our tests, the iPhone 7\u2019s battery lasted 18.5 hours., Which iPhone to Buy?, If you\u2019re looking for a new iPhone, is the X worth the $1,000 and up that Apple is charging? That depends on your preferences., \"A lot of people would argue that the iPhone X represents the future of smartphones. It boasts the best overall camera results in CRs testing and one of the best displays we\u2019ve ever seen on a phone. And while you don\u2019t get the familiar Home button, you pick up a decent amount of screen space in a phone that\u2019s significantly smaller than the 7 Plus and 8 Plus. It\u2019s easier to hold and use, not to mention lighter to carry.\", And Face ID works very effectively. The phone seems to unlock as soon as you pick it up and even think about making a call. Its gesture system takes some getting used to, but it\u2019s not overly cumbersome or difficult to use., Taken as a complete package, this phone ranked a bit lower than Samsung\u2019s S8, S8+, and Note8, mainly because of their superior battery life. But many longtime iPhone users aren\u2019t interested in switching to Android, so the real question for them is whether to save a few bucks\u2014or, actually, a couple hundred\u2014and go with an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus instead., These iPhones are more resistant to breaking, and they have the familiar Home button, which means you don\u2019t have to spend time learning a new system of swipes and button clicks. Because all these phones are top performers, the choice is ultimately a matter of personal priorities., Here\u2019s another idea: If you want to save even more money, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus remain viable options. They look pretty much the same as the 8 and 8 Plus and offer many of the same features. And they\u2019ll cost you just $550 and $670, respectively., If you\u2019re still on the fence, this is one of those times where it pays to try before you buy. Play with all of these phones in the store, paying attention to how much the gorgeous iPhone X display means to you and how you feel about learning new gestures\u2014and then considering how often you\u2019ve dropped previous gadgets on the sidewalk.",

Took photos, shoot videos and everything is fine\", The fourth day I realised the setback with the phone, the screen started having hairline scratches and thats where I realised what apple said about the toughest glass ever in smartphone statement is not correct. I was so upset to see a 75k phone screen scratches in a week. Went to iPhone store and to my surprise they say its a common complaint and suggested to put a screen guard., What a stupid thing from Apple to sell such and expensive and so poor quality screen. My 15K Motorola phone ever after an year of usage had not a single scratch., I strongly recommend to put screen guard on day 1 even though it looks ugly. such a shame from apple to build so low quality screen",

After speaking with Apple customer care for over 2 hours I am yet to receive a solution which may take 2-3 days! But come on!!! Its the basic function of a phone!\", My worst purchase ever!, Also if you still have to waste your money on this \"premium product\" then most definitely don\\t buy online through Amazon cause they provide zero support. They have a 10day return policy and your phone stops working on 14th day and you are abandoned and left on your own to deal with apple. Who btw don\\t replace your phone and instead do some \"investigation\" and take their own sweet time. And did I mention the problem is the basic feature of any phone!!!! Unable to hear anything on calls!!!!, And it doesn\\t matter what your review or feedback or your experience is  both Apple and Amazon care more about their \"profit-making policies\" rather than the customer\\s experience or problems. You can rest assured that your issues and feedback is just background noise to them. What\\s worse is that this was my gift to my mum. And it turned out to be an utter flop. Never again Amazon nor Apple.",

Have been using it for three weeks now and can safely say that this the best phone currently available in the market, with the Pixel XL a distant second., Pros:, - the end to end retina display is absolutely amazing. Apple TrueTone display adjusts better than Android phones with changes in ambient light, - software: iOS 11.2.5 is very user friendly and intuitive. My phone hasnt ever lagged or stuttered so far., - pretty good battery backup (easily lasting for an entire day on normal usage), - FaceID is a whole new ball game and apple wins it hands down. It is extremely accurate and easy to use and unlocks your phone as fast as fingerprint and even works in the dark. It is also secure as it checks if you are looking at the phone before performing a FaceID action. This is by far the best feature I felt on iPhone X and is a class apart from android phones., - the camera is really good in daylight and has a host of new features which includes portrait mode., Cons:, - I personally dont like the notch at the top and makes the display look a little ugly., - Fast charger is not provided in the box. The charger provided takes very long (~1 hr 45 min) to charge the phone., - Earphones provided are not of the best quality., - Front camera is pretty average and doesnt take exceptional pictures under dim lighting conditions., That said, iPhone X is overpriced and is definitely not value for money. But if you are willing to shell off money to get the best phone in the market then this is what you should buy.",

I won\u2019t even say it\u2019s overpriced as it\u2019s obvious that iPhone is an iPhone. It has excellent resale value and if at all I want to sell it after 2 years I think I can get a good value of course you need to protect your phone with a good case I like to keep my phone as good as New always! :-), Go for it. if you have the budget or can pay EMI  iphones do not really need a review!",

And my previous Xperia and Samsung flagships served well in that purpose. This time I have short listed Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X. Since the price difference between both of them are small and the lags on my last android phones compelled me to buy iPhone X. I have previously used iPhone 5S and 6 Plus for a short period. Both were 16gb and I returned to Android phones due to limited sharing options and lack of extra storage., Speaking of iPhone X, it is beautiful, heavy weighted, elegant by looks. The performance is very fast, the camera is just awesome. There is ton of iPhone X reviews on YouTube\/internet so I am not going to review it here.I am just sharing some pros and cons according to my usage, Protection Tips :-, Case :- I brought a SPIGEN Neon Ultra Hybrid Crystal case as that provides solid drop protection as well as has silver lining that matchs well with silver color of my phone, \"Screen Protector :- Here i brought MTT it has all the usual features some people may also go for the full body protection that even protects the top notch but that might add bulk but hey thats my opinion .\", Pros:, :- Super fast, :- Elegant & beautiful design., :- Large screen of 5.8 inch., :- Good battery backup. Lasts full day on heavy usage., :- Facial Recognition (Face ID), :- Great photos both day light and low light., :- Quad LED flash, :- Very good portrait photos.

It is very difficult to hold for long time. Hands get hurts., :- Large Screen  make one handed operation difficult., \":- Apples new image & video format is not supported by most devices.\", :- No complete file manager., :- No dedicated headphone jack. We should keep a Bluetooth headphone to use while charging., :- Limited sharing functionality., :- Un grouped notifications are annoying., :- IOS 11 is buggy and there is an update each weak., :- No fast charging adapter (We can charge using fast charging power bank or other phones adapter though), :- Same Design as android abet the notch, :- The back glass gonna break easily., :- We have to use a thick case to protect the camera due to camera bump., :- The stainless steel body is prone to a lot of scratches, :- battery percentage not shown up have to scroll down to see it hope IOS update will provide option, I have attached some photos taken using my iPhone X.

    "Desc": "The X might have the thinnest screen bezels of any iPhone, but it could only get there by ditching the physical home button. That also meant getting rid of TouchID fingerprint scanning, so instead we get FaceID facial recognition., It takes two cameras (one regular, one IR) an IR dot emitter and separate IR flood illuminator to accurately scan and recognise your face in less than half a second, and all that tech takes up space., The way it bulges out into the display is certainly unique. It\u2019s a bit like Marmite - you either love the distinctive look, or you hate the way it intrudes on your screen space. After a week with the phone, I\u2019m in the former camp - although the effect it has on software is another matter., Open an app that hasn\u2019t been updated yet and you\u2019ll get massive black borders at the top and bottom of the screen, or left and right when you\u2019re in landscape. The notch is unmissable in this mode when you open Safari, with certain web pages looking downright ugly., Apps that use Apple\u2019s autolayout fill the screen, but not always how you\u2019d expect - sometimes blocking out the battery indicator or losing UI elements offscreen. Even apps that have been updated can look a little funky., The fact that big names like Spotify didn\u2019t have updated apps ready to go on launch day is a bit of a joke., But anyway, back to the screen itself. It\u2019s a 5.8in panel, technically making it larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the 19.5:9 aspect ratio means it\u2019s more like an iPhone 8 stretched vertically. Add in the notch and that\u2019s quite a lot of dead space in certain apps and games., Honestly, though? It\u2019s difficult to mind that much - the screen is absolutely phenomenal. That\u2019s mainly down to the switch from LCD to OLED, giving the X the impeccable contrast and deep, inky blacks that have been impressing us on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones for years., Resolution has leapt up to 2436x1125, a big change from the iPhone 8 Plus and its 1080p panel. Pentile panel tech might not resolve as much detail as an RGB LCD screen, but some clever anti-aliasing on Apple\u2019s part means it\u2019s difficult to spot any lack of detail., OLED panels can end up so looking ridiculously vibrant you\u2019ll want to wear sunglasses whenever you look at them, but Apple has been pretty restrained here: photos and videos on the X still pop with colour, but they stay on the right side of realistic., TrueTone colour calibration helps here, automatically tweaking the colour temperature to match the ambient light around you. It\u2019s a subtle effect, but you\u2019ll notice the difference when you flick it on and off in the settings screen., It gets impressively bright for an OLED panel, too. I had no problem reading the screen outdoors on a sunny day., That brightness comes in handy for HDR video - the X supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Netflix is already updated, and works great on a good connection, with a great range of colour and more depth to dark scenes., For all the pitchforks and torches banging on Google\u2019s door over the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s off-angle colour shift, the iPhone X isn\u2019t immune from the effects either., With no home button, the X makes you rethink how to use your iPhone. And it all starts with FaceID., Instead of tapping the fingerprint sensor, you now raise the phone, tap anywhere onscreen or press the side button to wake it, then swipe up from the bottom of the display to get past the lock screen., Normally, in the time you\u2019ve done all that, FaceID has fired out thousands of tiny infra red dots, scanned them with an IR camera, and mapped your face. All your contours, curves, bumps and ridges make for a unique ID that\u2019s even more difficult to fool than a fingerprint sensor., As you\u2019ve only got one face (I hope), you don\u2019t have to consider which hand you\u2019ll be picking up the phone with, or to hold it in a certain way so your finger lines up with a physical button - handy if you found the iPhone 8 just a little bit too small, or the Plus that little bit too big., When FaceID works, it works brilliantly, taking less than half a second to recognise you and unlock the phone. Over time, it\u2019ll get better at recognising you, tracking things like hair and beard growth so as not to get confused. Go for a shave and buzzcut and you might need to retrain it, though., It worked through sunglasses, while I was wearing chunky headphones, and with a hoodie covering my hair, but leaning my hand on my chin could sometimes defeat it., Lying in bed, I would often hold the phone too close to get a match, and it\u2019s harder to unlock while sat on your desk than the old TouchID system., It might not be 100% accurate, but it\u2019s still better than any other face scanner we\u2019ve tried on a phone, including the ones found on some Samsungs. When it does fail, you\u2019ve got to tap in a passcode - just like you would with TouchID., It\u2019s not exactly elegant, but it\u2019s rare enough not to be annoying - unless you\u2019re stood at a London Underground ticket barrier, with a queue of people behind you. Double-tapping the side button to invoke Apple Pay and waiting for a face match feels a little bit slower than the old TouchID system, but maybe that\u2019ll change once it becomes second nature., All these face-scanning shenanigans might sound serious, but there\u2019s a lighter side to it all too. Fire up iMessage and you can play with Animoji: animated emoji characters that you can move with your face., By motion-tracking your facial features, the phone can animate your eyes and expressions perfectly, recording your voice in sync for sending as messages to your mates. It\u2019s purely for fun, and all but guaranteed to annoy your non-iPhone X equipped mates, but undeniably cute at the same time., While the notch might seem like a big deal, it totally disappears once you\u2019ve spent a few hours with the phone. With most day-to-day tasks, you won\u2019t really notice it, especially when using the iPhone X in portrait mode. What you will notice over time is how the entire iOS UI has been redesigned around it., Until now, iPhone models have had an ever-present (unless you are in the full-screen mode) bar that\u2019s been used to display all kinds of important information from the time, to signal strength, and to even indicate if some app is using your location information. With the iPhone X\u2019s notch, there\u2019s very little space for all this information - the left side is taken up entirely by the clock, while the right only has room for the signal strength indicator, 3G\/ 4G\/ Wi-Fi indicator, and the battery icon., You no longer see things like the name of the network, which might not seem like a big loss, but there are two other compromises that will potentially be more upsetting for most users. The battery percentage and Bluetooth connection status are now only visible only if you swipe down from the right of the notch, and there\u2019s no way to have them always visible. If you use Bluetooth devices like AirPods, speakers, or in-car units, you can no longer tell at a glance if your phone is connected., The notch will bother you in full-screen games and videos, or if you use the your phone in landscape mode a lot. By default, the aspect ratio of the iPhone X\u2019s display means that most videos will play with thick enough black bands on the left and right that the notch will blend in without any problems. However, if you choose to zoom in - by using pinch-to-zoom in the YouTube app for example - you bring the notch into play, even as the video gets cropped like on any other device. We regularly watched videos zoomed-in and it didn\u2019t bother us one bit, but your mileage may vary., On the other hand, we did like some of the changes that the notch\u2019s presence has resulted in. One of our favourite iOS features is the ability to scroll to the top of any list or page by tapping the bar at top. However, if some app is using your location in the background, or if some device is connected to the hotspot on your phone, this functionality breaks as tapping on the bar then takes you to the app using your location in the background, or the Hotspot settings, as the case may be. With the iPhone X, the location\/ hotspot alerts are restricted to the left \u201cear\u201d, which means you can still tap the notch or the right ear to scroll to the top of any list - that\u2019s right, the notch does recognise your taps., We\u2019ve spent considerable time talking about the notch, but if you are wondering what exactly it is, this little section is for you. With the iPhone X doing away with the Home button - and with it the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Apple needed a new way for us to quickly and securely log in to our devices and authorise payments. The solution is Face ID, and the notch contains the front camera and 3D sensing sensors that make this technology possible., The three main components here are the infrared camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector. The latter projects \u201cmore than 30,000 invisible dots\u201d onto your face to build a 3D map that can be used to identify you. The flood illuminator makes it possible to do that in the dark by emitting invisible infrared light, and the infrared camera reads the dot pattern. The infrared image is sent to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip - a special area that\u2019s used to store biometric data on the chip that powers the iPhone X - to confirm a match. Like with Touch ID, Apple says no biometric data actually leaves the device at any point, which means that your privacy is assured., The day the iPhone X was announced - and well before we had spent any meaningful time with it - we said that Face ID felt like a compromise, that it could never be as fast as Touch ID, and that Apple would go back to using fingerprint scanners as soon as it could figure out how to embed them into the glass fronts of its phones . A couple of months into having used the iPhone X, it\u2019s safe to say that while Face ID might not have the raw speed of Touch ID, a move away from Face ID won\u2019t be because of any significant drawbacks in the technology., It works seamlessly on most occasions, and more reliably than we\u2019d imagined it would going into our review. It\u2019s almost like having any no passcode or security feature on your device. That might not be a change for many people - despite manufacturers\u2019 warnings during the setup process, we find an uncomfortably large number of people continue to use their smartphones without a passcode - but for everyone else, Face ID reduces the extra step of unlocking your phone before you can use it.Granted, most of us had become accustomed to using fingerprints to the point that it never felt like an \u201cadditional step\u201d, but now, at most times, you can just pick up your iPhone X and trust that Face ID is just authenticating you in the background., For all practical purposes, this feels like using a phone without a passcode. This is especially great when you are interacting with notifications. Before the iPhone X, tapping on a notification - say, to read an email - on a locked device meant using Touch ID or needing to enter passcode to unlock before you could proceed. With Face ID, the additional step is removed, and you can now interact with notifications as originally intended, The \u2018notch\u2019 is where all the Face ID bits are housed, Face ID isn\u2019t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint scanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn\u2019t a problem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a shrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn\u2019t close enough to my face. If you\u2019re the type of person who tries to sneak a look at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you\u2019re out of luck., Apps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically be replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course use it for Apple Pay payments too., iPhone X \u2013 Screen, The iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel for the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have been using this technology for some time now, and it\u2019s nice to see Apple finally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is also the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436 x 1125 pixels, plus there\u2019s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby Vision HDR., OLEDs offer better contrast, true blacks and a more colourful picture, but they\u2019re not always perfect. The LG panels used by Google in the Pixel 2 XL have come in for plenty of criticism for poor viewing angles and an odd blue tinge. Even the excellent screen on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is prone to suffering poor viewing angles., Apple\u2019s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there\u2019s a small shift to blue if you tilt the device off-axis, it\u2019s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL. Apple says it\u2019s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company\u2019s optimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung\u2019s approach for its own Galaxy S8 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the saturation isn\u2019t quite so intense., At last, The Good A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine., The Bad New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It\u2019ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone Plus models., The Bottom Line iPhone X is an overdue and winning evolution of the iPhone, but you\u2019ll need to leave your comfort zone to make a jump into the face-recognizing future., If you find this helpful vote helpful button.",

    "Desc": "\"Its important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gathers and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business\", # New screen (5.8\u201d OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple), # Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7\/8 Plus., # Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly., # The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors., # Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way., # The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera., # The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening., # The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it., # I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom., # This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything., # This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background., # The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions., # Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images., # Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market, # Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design., # Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing., # In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone)., Best mobile ever\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.",

    "Desc": "The flagship phone from Apple is undoubtedly a marvel though the price tag was a big deterrent for me. Before finalizing, I compared it with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Google Pixel 2 - on almost all accounts I found iPhone X definitely more superior. My assessment after using it for 2 weeks is as follows:, Pros, 1. The Face ID is a first - a technological leap. It works most of the time except when the room is completely dark., 2. Speakers - This caught my attention immediately, the speakers on the bottom of the phone simply rock., 3. Screen - Is a little annoying initially but then Apple had to embed the facial recognition technology somewhere, you can live with it especially after you notice the brightness of the screen along with crystal clear display, 4. Battery - Fairly decent, easily lasts a day with heavy usage of checking mails, surfing the net and video streaming., 5. Camera: The images are very impressive though Apple still has massive competition from Samsung here., 5. Looks - While there is nothing extraordinary, it does have a premium feel look and is heavy as compared to the earlier iPhone. A backcover ruins the feel of the phone but then it saves from potential damage it just in case if slips from your hand and falls on a hard\/rough surface., Cons, \"1. The price but then everyones buying without complaining so one cant do much.\", \"If you can afford it, close your eyes and buy it - simply worth it. Also for people who cant tolerate bloatware and restricted app privacy settings in Android, this phone has it all\"",

    "Desc": "Do not buy this phone. Its an extremely over-hyped & overpriced phone. Going with the apple-hype I pre-ordered this phone elsewhere, used it for 2 weeks extensively & sold it b4 its too late to take a fresh breath of air. Keypoints as below:, . Very fragile back, backglass shatters even from 5 feet drop and then it costs above Rs 35000., . Face id is not convenient at all.Its not secure as well as per latest data., . If front glass breaks, it makes the face id unusable. And then pay a bomb to replace the front panel., . iOS is not optimised for this iPhone X yet resulting in buggy, sluggish performances, better wait for next gen iPhone X in 2018., . US price is around 67000 INR including tax and Indian price is Rs 89000 for the 64 gb model and similar price difference for the 256 gb model as well., .Notch kills the \"show\" while doing anything on the screen., .Stainless steel rim is gimmicky and is highly prone to scratches even after protective cases worn., .Crackling sounds-that can be heard when using the iPhone X speakerphone at high volumes., If you are a die hard fan of Apple iPhones, then get the iPhone 8 Plus, you will less regret., Do not allow Apple to make fool out of Indian consumers., #Just because I am not a \"verified buyer\" here, amazon does not stop me from speaking and writing truth#., ., Update (23\/01\/2018):, Though the hype worked for Apple initially, due to the phone itself being inferior, the sales of iPhone X has declined all over the world recently.Also, as per many reliable sources(CNET, MASHABLE, BGR etc.,just Google it out), Apple will be discontinuing the production of this first gen iPhone X in 2018 itself to keep its \"brand value\" once the next gen comes up.",
