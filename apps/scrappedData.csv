But I ask how is this different from the notifications and quick toggle on Android which is also a swipe down from the top? With the new breed of 18:9 screen aspect ratio Android phones which are taller than ever before, this gesture is none the easier. I give it a score of 7.5/10', '• FaceID- Works like a charm. The sensors are very forgiving of the angle but it won’t work if you’re holding your phone upside down or sideways. Apart from that, it works very well. It has a wide range of view. You don’t have to be dead centre in front of the phone for it to unlock. Works with sunglasses and spectacles and has no problem either in pitch dark or bright sunlight as long as the sun is not on your face or behind you. Prospective buyers shouldn’t have any apprehensions regarding it. Apple has given us a very good alternative to TouchID. It scores 8/10', '• Front camera portrait- Nothing special. You have to try several times for it to give an acceptable result. Doesn’t compare well with the Pixel 2 phones. Yet, the skin tones on the iPhone are always far more natural than its Android counterparts. Doesn’t deserve more than 6/10', '• OLED Display- You really have to look for differences between the IPS LCD of the 8 plus and the X. Apple does such a good job with the calibration of their displays that, frankly, I don’t see much difference in the quality of colours between the OLED iPhone X and the LCD 8 plus. Yes the OLED has more contrast compared to the LCD but if you’re looking to buy a phone purely for the punchy saturation and vividness of an OLED display, this is not it. You’d do well to look at the Samsung Note8. Apple always favours colour accuracy over vividness. The display quality deserves an 8/10', '• Battery life is better than the 8 but worse than the 8 plus. There’s no competition. If you’re a heavy user, you will not get a full day’s use out of it. Plus, charging it is even slower than the 8 plus as the battery is actually bigger in size. Wireless charging is on board but is very slow in my experience. I have the Samsung fast charger that comes with the Note8 and use it to charge this phone. The battery scores 6/10.', '• Animoji- Fun if you spend too much time messaging people on iMessage. The novelty of it will wear off. The problem is that Apple has made us think it is some futuristic cutting edge tech built into its TrueDepth sensors when it actually isn’t. It is just using the front camera for face tracking and there’s no reason why it can’t be ported over to the 8 or older iPhones. But we know that is never going to happen. Apple will keep updating new characters to keep Animoji interesting. I give it a 5/10 because it is marketed as something which it isn’t.', 'MY SCORE - 6.75/10', '• FAQs-', '1- How is the size and in-hand feel?-  The size of the phone is much more manageable in one hand. The screen is narrower and gives less screen space than the plus model. It feels solid and premium in the hand. No creaking sounds yet.', '2- How bad is ""The Notch""? - Doesn’t bother me anywhere outside Youtube videos or other video streaming platforms. It does cut into the video if you decide to expand the video to make full use of the available screen. It’s not noticeable in general usage like browsing, social media or messaging.', 'CONCLUDING THOUGHTS- In my experience, one has to look at both the iPhone 8/8plus and the iPhone X in isolation to fully appreciate them. If one spends time comparing them, they’re bound to feel frustrated as there are far too many similarities to justify the huge price difference. If you’re someone who must have the shiniest offering from Apple, then the X is for you. But, if you want bang for your buck, then go for the 8 plus, as it is pound for pound the better phone between the two. The differences are simply not enough to justify spending extra. The camera performance, processor, RAM, storage options, apps, software features are the same and the X doesn’t offer as many extras that make it stand apart from its sibling. Maybe next year, Apple?', ""IS IT WORTH IT?- There won’t be a cop out here. If you're contemplating between this and the 8 plus, in my opinion, to buy this phone, this year, at this price, is not worth it. (My purchase price was 87.5k). Even if you can afford it, or have an iPhone above the 6s/Plus, you can skip it without much remorse. iPhone 7/7 plus are still great phones and if you can hold off another year, then the 2018 lineup of iPhones is shaping up to be pretty exciting. Compared to the iPhone 8 plus, all the features this phone offers either looked at in isolation or even as a whole, do not justify getting it. Going forward, all iPhones are going to be designed like this and improve upon it. It’s not a limited edition model which is a must have."", ""If this is going to be your first iPhone or if you're looking to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s, go ahead. It is a great phone and you won't regret getting it."", 'I have put photos of the phone here. For the camera samples, please see my iPhone 8 plus review as there is no difference in photo quality between the two. Here is the link--- https://www.amazon.in/gp/review/R6DSET4ETOTXH/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8', 'X vs XS- The hardware upgrades between the X and XS are as follows-', 'The speakers are slightly better, the camera records video in stereo mode, the water resistance rating has improved from IP67 to IP68, there is 4GB RAM now, the bokeh is adjustable in the portrait shots, Smart HDR takes multi frame pics like the Pixel 2, photos have much improved dynamic range and there’s a new gold colour. Apart from the camera improvements, there is not much that markedly improve your experience if you’ve been using the X the past year. Apple knows this too and have positioned the XS and XS Max as upgrades for people using older iPhones. (6, 6s, 7, 8) If you’re using any of these phones, the upgrade makes sense. iPhone X users are better off waiting till next year.', 'Price update as on October 9, 2018- Since the 64GB iPhone X is now available at 69,990/- on Amazon, it is a better deal and worth considering for all those who have waited all this while and stayed away from the X due to the high price tag.']]"

If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction.', 'The transition:', ""NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand)."", 'Face ID:', ""I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode."", ""It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook)."", 'What I love:', '- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).', ""- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it."", ""- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store."", ""- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth."", '- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.', '- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.', '- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.', '- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.', ""What I don't:"", 'Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.']]"

Yes. Is it the best? Well, No.', ""Let's break it down into pros and cons and discuss what's in the package."", 'Pros:-', '1. It is one of the most powerful smartphone in the market. Apple has done a great job coming up with A11 bionic chip which is on par with snapdragon 845 chip that came significantly later. A11 chip coupled with greatly optimized IOS makes this phone faster than almost 95% smartphones available. The faceid with ir dot projection is most secure than any other.', '2. The latest released iOS 11 comes packed with features and is faster than ever. It has the most simplistic and natural user interface on a smartphone.', '3. It has currently the 3rd best camera present on any smartphone out there after the samsung galaxy s9+ and HUawei p20 pro. But unlike the first two, it provides more details,similar quality in a smaller image size meaning it takes up less storage space.', '4. I am just in love with the design of this phone. The phone is just gorgeous, i mean just beautiful. Depending on who you ask, the notch is debatable but i dont mind it because it giver more screen space. But with more and more phones coming with the notch, you just have to accept that its going to stay.', '5. The biggest selling point of apple devices is the after sales service that apple provides, being it software updates, hardware issues or just any customer support whatsoever. Apple service is best in class and nobody can argue that.', '6. Another aspect of apple devices is the ecosystem that apple has created, every apple device you own is connected to each other all the time. This feature is really convenient and you get all your notifications at all your device, you can continue anything on each of your devices where you left it.', 'Cons:-', ""1.Let's face the biggest let down of this phone, the price which is even more increased here in india. US price is 1000 $ and its indian price converted into dollars sums upto 1500$ which is absurd. Considering all the benefits, it is still too high which kind of overshadows everything else."", '2. Unlocking the phone with faceid is a two step process which annoying and slow as compared to other phones.', 'Conclusion:- All in all it is a great phone, if it was available between a price bracket of 65-70k rupees. It could have been a great purchase.']]"

It is slightly larger than iPhone 8 but smaller than iPhone 8 S. I have attached images taken from Apple store for comparison.', '- Camera - It has the best ever camera on an iPhone. I said on iPhone, because there are devices like Pixel 2, Mi 8 , Huawei P20 Pro that comes with half the price of iPhone x and better camera.', '- Shooting videos - I have always noticed that iPhone offers an edge in video quality over other phones of similar specs', '- Waterproof - iPhone X is rated IP67. A lot of people lose their phones due to water damage. Sometimes, an iphone can save you from buying a new phone, which is a kind of cost saving. Especially if you spend a lot of time in pool, outdoor activities this might be a boon. Also you can shoot a lot of underground videos.', 'Cons', ""- Costly, yes iPhone X comes at a very premium price. It's a phone made for high class category only"", '- If you are looking for best camera phone, go for something else. You can get a Pixel 2, Mi8 , or P20 for less than half price. These phones have better Dxomark scores than iPhoneX. Head on to Dxo Mark website and check.', 'Being an iPhone user for a long time, i would also like to list a few cons and pros of using iPhone compared to Android', 'iPhone Pros', ' - If you have a mac, iPhone can work seamlessly with mac. The same apps are available for mac and iPhone which syncs seamlessly. Calendar, TODOs, Notes, Contacts etc helps me a lot. I add a todo from my mac and next moment i have it on my phone too. That works great.', '- If you are someone who is hooked up to mac always, you can easily attend your calls on mac ig both devices are on same network. I have found this really helpful', '- Apple makes the best non bud type earphones in my experience. Personally i do not like in ear canal earphones as they can impair hearing. I have found no other good alternatives to Apple earphones in terms of audio clarity. But yes you can get better over the ear or in canal earphones.', '- Physical button for silent mode - Yes, thats a quick and comfy shortcut to turn your phone silent even without unlocking it/turning screen on. If you are a person who attends a lot of meetings and requires to turn phone silent, this can be quite helpful. You can quickly check the button position and say your phone is silent or not.', 'iPhone Cons', ""-  Accessories are costly - If you need to buy an extra cable(maybe for office) or adapter, you need to shell somewhere between 1500 to 2500 bucks. Chinese accessories won't work well and perfect with iPhone"", '- iOS is buggy at times. I have to admit that. Not just that, apple bug fixing is very slow compared to Googles Android', '-  Apple music is slighly costly comapred to Google music - 120 rs per month', 'If you are looking for cheaper alternatives, i would suggest you the Google Pixel 2. Google pixel comes with Unlimited Original quality photo and video storage. On iPhone, for the same thing you have to shell out additional 75INR per month for 50 GB. For higher storage you need to pay more. If you are a person who shoots a lot of videos, Googles Unlimited storage can save you a lot of money. However you can install Google photos and get Unlimited Normal backup for photos and videos on any iOS/Android phone, where Google converts the files to reduce quality. For images, its quite ok, the difference is barely noticeable, but for videos yes , they convert it to One-fourth the size.']]"

If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction.', 'The transition:', ""NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand)."", 'Face ID:', ""I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode."", ""It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook)."", 'The price:', ""There seems to be this running idea that a Rs.89,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phones are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly Rs. 10,000 a month on EMI for 9 months. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was Rs.70,000. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and be utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there."", 'What I love:', '- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).', ""- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it."", ""- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store."", ""- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth."", '- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.', '- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.', '- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.', '- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.', ""What I don't:"", 'Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.']]"

In fact, if you combine the performance scores for stills and video, this is the highest-rated smartphone camera Consumer Reports has tested.', 'Like the 7 Plus and 8 Plus, the iPhone X has a second, 2X zoom camera on the back of the phone. But unlike those other iPhones, both of the iPhone X’s backside cameras have optical image stabilization, which steadies the lenses to offset the effects of shaky hands. (The 7 Plus and 8 Plus have that feature on only one camera lens.)', 'This setup produced impressive results when testers compared photos using the zoom to those shot using the zoom lenses of earlier iPhone Plus models. Stills taken with the iPhone X were sharp, with excellent color reproduction, and video was very sharp as well.', 'Convenient Face ID', 'Much has been made of Apple’s decision to do away with the Home button on the iPhone X. That opened up screen real estate, but when the Home button disappeared, the embedded fingerprint sensor went with it, and Apple now relies upon a new biometric feature for authenticating users. Called Face ID, the technology maps your features and lets you unlock the phone simply by taking a look at the screen. (You can also type in a PIN.)', 'We found the setup and unlocking process to be both quick and easy. The technology worked when we held the phone at all but the most severe angles and did not falter when used by testers with a wide range of skin tones, even when they put on reading glasses. You need to look directly at the screen to prompt it to unlock, making it less likely that you’ll unlock the device inadvertently.', 'The removal of the Home button requires you to learn a series of new swipe and button commands to operate the phone. This takes a little getting used to. But our testers picked up on the new gestures quickly and were satisfied with the phone’s overall usability.', ""The iPhone X's Shortcomings"", 'Broken Glass', 'In our initial drop test, the iPhone X performed just fine. It survived four falls onto a concrete surface from a height of 5 feet. For that quick test, we used our custom-designed Drop Tower and let the phone fall on its front, back, and two different corners.', 'However, iPhone X phones didn’t fare nearly as well when subjected to a more intensive lab test in a tumbling machine. The tumbler is a rotating chamber that repeatedly drops a phone from a height of about 2.5 feet. The phones are checked for damage after 50 drops and then again after 100.', 'The goal of all that repetition is to expose the phone to impacts from a wide variety of angles.', 'We tumbled three samples of the iPhone X. The first was fine after 50 drops, but the glass on the back was significantly cracked after 100. The other two phones ended up with malfunctioning displays after 50 drops. Though the front glass didn’t crack, several bright green bars stretched across the screens from top to bottom.', 'The iPhone X isn’t the first phone to fail our tumble test. For example, our testers also reported broken displays and back panels when they tumbled Samsung’s nearly all-glass Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones.', 'In light of those results, we recommend that you protect any of these phones in a case.', 'Responding to our findings, Apple affirmed the iPhone X\'s durability based on the company\'s ""rigorous real world testing"" and said that the phone ""is made from the most durable glass ever in a smartphone.""', 'Durability is something to think about if you’re considering a purchase of the iPhone X. The phone isn’t just expensive to buy; it’s also unusually pricey to repair. For example, the Apple Store will charge you $279 to fix the display and $549 to fix any other part of the phone, including its glass back. (This could make it worthwhile for some consumers to shell out for AppleCare+ coverage, which costs $199.)', 'Tumble tests don’t get a lot of weight when we calculate a phone’s Overall Score. However, these results combined with the iPhone X’s comparatively low battery-life showing (see below) did knock the phone down a few spots in our rankings, says Fisco, who leads CR’s phone testing program.', 'On the flip side, the iPhone X aced our water-resistance testing, surviving for 30 minutes at a depth of about 3 feet, just as Apple promises in its specs. The phone was examined right afterward, as well as one, two, and three days later, and continued to work.', 'This is consistent with the results for other recent Apple phones, including the 7- and 8-series iPhones, which also did well in our water-immersion tests.', 'Short Battery Life', 'The iPhone X’s battery life hurt the phone’s Overall Score in Consumer Reports testing.', 'To find out exactly how long a phone’s battery can go, Consumer Reports uses a robotic finger programmed to put the phone through a range of tasks designed to simulate a consumer’s average day.', 'The robot browses the internet, takes pictures, uses GPS navigation, and, of course, makes phone calls. We run all smartphone battery tests with the display set to 100 percent brightness. If you use any phone’s auto, or adaptive, brightness, the battery should last longer.', 'In our testing, the iPhone X’s battery lasted 19.5 hours. That’s just ahead of the 19 hours logged by the iPhone 8 and the considerably smaller iPhone SE but below the 21 hours recorded by the 8 Plus—and it’s far less than the 26 hours that Samsung’s S8 and S8+ delivered. (Some other smartphones in our ratings run even longer on a charge.)', 'While for many people 19.5 hours is enough to get them through the day, it’s still shorter than the majority of the 38 smartphones we recommend.', 'According to Apple, the iPhone X’s A11 Bionic chip is designed to manage the device’s power supply intelligently, balancing the demands for speed and energy in a way that permits you to complete the tasks you perform most often—think texting or web browsing—with optimal efficiency.', 'When you combine that with the model’s custom battery design, the company says, the iPhone X should last “up to 2 hours longer between charges than the iPhone 7.” In our tests, the iPhone 7’s battery lasted 18.5 hours.', 'Which iPhone to Buy?', 'If you’re looking for a new iPhone, is the X worth the $1,000 and up that Apple is charging? That depends on your preferences.', ""A lot of people would argue that the iPhone X represents the future of smartphones. It boasts the best overall camera results in CR's testing and one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a phone. And while you don’t get the familiar Home button, you pick up a decent amount of screen space in a phone that’s significantly smaller than the 7 Plus and 8 Plus. It’s easier to hold and use, not to mention lighter to carry."", 'And Face ID works very effectively. The phone seems to unlock as soon as you pick it up and even think about making a call. Its gesture system takes some getting used to, but it’s not overly cumbersome or difficult to use.', 'Taken as a complete package, this phone ranked a bit lower than Samsung’s S8, S8+, and Note8, mainly because of their superior battery life. But many longtime iPhone users aren’t interested in switching to Android, so the real question for them is whether to save a few bucks—or, actually, a couple hundred—and go with an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus instead.', 'These iPhones are more resistant to breaking, and they have the familiar Home button, which means you don’t have to spend time learning a new system of swipes and button clicks. Because all these phones are top performers, the choice is ultimately a matter of personal priorities.', 'Here’s another idea: If you want to save even more money, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus remain viable options. They look pretty much the same as the 8 and 8 Plus and offer many of the same features. And they’ll cost you just $550 and $670, respectively.', 'If you’re still on the fence, this is one of those times where it pays to try before you buy. Play with all of these phones in the store, paying attention to how much the gorgeous iPhone X display means to you and how you feel about learning new gestures—and then considering how often you’ve dropped previous gadgets on the sidewalk.']]"

That also meant getting rid of TouchID fingerprint scanning, so instead we get FaceID facial recognition.', 'It takes two cameras (one regular, one IR) an IR dot emitter and separate IR flood illuminator to accurately scan and recognise your face in less than half a second, and all that tech takes up space.', 'The way it bulges out into the display is certainly unique. It’s a bit like Marmite - you either love the distinctive look, or you hate the way it intrudes on your screen space. After a week with the phone, I’m in the former camp - although the effect it has on software is another matter.', 'Open an app that hasn’t been updated yet and you’ll get massive black borders at the top and bottom of the screen, or left and right when you’re in landscape. The notch is unmissable in this mode when you open Safari, with certain web pages looking downright ugly.', 'Apps that use Apple’s autolayout fill the screen, but not always how you’d expect - sometimes blocking out the battery indicator or losing UI elements offscreen. Even apps that have been updated can look a little funky.', 'The fact that big names like Spotify didn’t have updated apps ready to go on launch day is a bit of a joke.', 'But anyway, back to the screen itself. It’s a 5.8in panel, technically making it larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the 19.5:9 aspect ratio means it’s more like an iPhone 8 stretched vertically. Add in the notch and that’s quite a lot of dead space in certain apps and games.', 'Honestly, though? It’s difficult to mind that much - the screen is absolutely phenomenal. That’s mainly down to the switch from LCD to OLED, giving the X the impeccable contrast and deep, inky blacks that have been impressing us on Samsung’s Galaxy phones for years.', 'Resolution has leapt up to 2436x1125, a big change from the iPhone 8 Plus and its 1080p panel. Pentile panel tech might not resolve as much detail as an RGB LCD screen, but some clever anti-aliasing on Apple’s part means it’s difficult to spot any lack of detail.', 'OLED panels can end up so looking ridiculously vibrant you’ll want to wear sunglasses whenever you look at them, but Apple has been pretty restrained here: photos and videos on the X still pop with colour, but they stay on the right side of realistic.', 'TrueTone colour calibration helps here, automatically tweaking the colour temperature to match the ambient light around you. It’s a subtle effect, but you’ll notice the difference when you flick it on and off in the settings screen.', 'It gets impressively bright for an OLED panel, too. I had no problem reading the screen outdoors on a sunny day.', 'That brightness comes in handy for HDR video - the X supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Netflix is already updated, and works great on a good connection, with a great range of colour and more depth to dark scenes.', 'For all the pitchforks and torches banging on Google’s door over the Pixel 2 XL’s off-angle colour shift, the iPhone X isn’t immune from the effects either.', 'With no home button, the X makes you rethink how to use your iPhone. And it all starts with FaceID.', 'Instead of tapping the fingerprint sensor, you now raise the phone, tap anywhere onscreen or press the side button to wake it, then swipe up from the bottom of the display to get past the lock screen.', 'Normally, in the time you’ve done all that, FaceID has fired out thousands of tiny infra red dots, scanned them with an IR camera, and mapped your face. All your contours, curves, bumps and ridges make for a unique ID that’s even more difficult to fool than a fingerprint sensor.', 'As you’ve only got one face (I hope), you don’t have to consider which hand you’ll be picking up the phone with, or to hold it in a certain way so your finger lines up with a physical button - handy if you found the iPhone 8 just a little bit too small, or the Plus that little bit too big.', 'When FaceID works, it works brilliantly, taking less than half a second to recognise you and unlock the phone. Over time, it’ll get better at recognising you, tracking things like hair and beard growth so as not to get confused. Go for a shave and buzzcut and you might need to retrain it, though.', 'It worked through sunglasses, while I was wearing chunky headphones, and with a hoodie covering my hair, but leaning my hand on my chin could sometimes defeat it.', 'Lying in bed, I would often hold the phone too close to get a match, and it’s harder to unlock while sat on your desk than the old TouchID system.', 'It might not be 100% accurate, but it’s still better than any other face scanner we’ve tried on a phone, including the ones found on some Samsungs. When it does fail, you’ve got to tap in a passcode - just like you would with TouchID.', 'It’s not exactly elegant, but it’s rare enough not to be annoying - unless you’re stood at a London Underground ticket barrier, with a queue of people behind you. Double-tapping the side button to invoke Apple Pay and waiting for a face match feels a little bit slower than the old TouchID system, but maybe that’ll change once it becomes second nature.', 'All these face-scanning shenanigans might sound serious, but there’s a lighter side to it all too. Fire up iMessage and you can play with Animoji: animated emoji characters that you can move with your face.', 'By motion-tracking your facial features, the phone can animate your eyes and expressions perfectly, recording your voice in sync for sending as messages to your mates. It’s purely for fun, and all but guaranteed to annoy your non-iPhone X equipped mates, but undeniably cute at the same time.', 'While the notch might seem like a big deal, it totally disappears once you’ve spent a few hours with the phone. With most day-to-day tasks, you won’t really notice it, especially when using the iPhone X in portrait mode. What you will notice over time is how the entire iOS UI has been redesigned around it.', 'Until now, iPhone models have had an ever-present (unless you are in the full-screen mode) bar that’s been used to display all kinds of important information from the time, to signal strength, and to even indicate if some app is using your location information. With the iPhone X’s notch, there’s very little space for all this information - the left side is taken up entirely by the clock, while the right only has room for the signal strength indicator, 3G/ 4G/ Wi-Fi indicator, and the battery icon.', 'You no longer see things like the name of the network, which might not seem like a big loss, but there are two other compromises that will potentially be more upsetting for most users. The battery percentage and Bluetooth connection status are now only visible only if you swipe down from the right of the notch, and there’s no way to have them always visible. If you use Bluetooth devices like AirPods, speakers, or in-car units, you can no longer tell at a glance if your phone is connected.', 'The notch will bother you in full-screen games and videos, or if you use the your phone in landscape mode a lot. By default, the aspect ratio of the iPhone X’s display means that most videos will play with thick enough black bands on the left and right that the notch will blend in without any problems. However, if you choose to zoom in - by using pinch-to-zoom in the YouTube app for example - you bring the notch into play, even as the video gets cropped like on any other device. We regularly watched videos zoomed-in and it didn’t bother us one bit, but your mileage may vary.', 'On the other hand, we did like some of the changes that the notch’s presence has resulted in. One of our favourite iOS features is the ability to scroll to the top of any list or page by tapping the bar at top. However, if some app is using your location in the background, or if some device is connected to the hotspot on your phone, this functionality breaks as tapping on the bar then takes you to the app using your location in the background, or the Hotspot settings, as the case may be. With the iPhone X, the location/ hotspot alerts are restricted to the left “ear”, which means you can still tap the notch or the right ear to scroll to the top of any list - that’s right, the notch does recognise your taps.', 'We’ve spent considerable time talking about the notch, but if you are wondering what exactly it is, this little section is for you. With the iPhone X doing away with the Home button - and with it the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Apple needed a new way for us to quickly and securely log in to our devices and authorise payments. The solution is Face ID, and the notch contains the front camera and 3D sensing sensors that make this technology possible.', 'The three main components here are the infrared camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector. The latter projects “more than 30,000 invisible dots” onto your face to build a 3D map that can be used to identify you. The flood illuminator makes it possible to do that in the dark by emitting invisible infrared light, and the infrared camera reads the dot pattern. The infrared image is sent to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip - a special area that’s used to store biometric data on the chip that powers the iPhone X - to confirm a match. Like with Touch ID, Apple says no biometric data actually leaves the device at any point, which means that your privacy is assured.', 'The day the iPhone X was announced - and well before we had spent any meaningful time with it - we said that Face ID felt like a compromise, that it could never be as fast as Touch ID, and that Apple would go back to using fingerprint scanners as soon as it could figure out how to embed them into the glass fronts of its phones . A couple of months into having used the iPhone X, it’s safe to say that while Face ID might not have the raw speed of Touch ID, a move away from Face ID won’t be because of any significant drawbacks in the technology.', 'It works seamlessly on most occasions, and more reliably than we’d imagined it would going into our review. It’s almost like having any no passcode or security feature on your device. That might not be a change for many people - despite manufacturers’ warnings during the setup process, we find an uncomfortably large number of people continue to use their smartphones without a passcode - but for everyone else, Face ID reduces the extra step of unlocking your phone before you can use it.Granted, most of us had become accustomed to using fingerprints to the point that it never felt like an “additional step”, but now, at most times, you can just pick up your iPhone X and trust that Face ID is just authenticating you in the background.', 'For all practical purposes, this feels like using a phone without a passcode. This is especially great when you are interacting with notifications. Before the iPhone X, tapping on a notification - say, to read an email - on a locked device meant using Touch ID or needing to enter passcode to unlock before you could proceed. With Face ID, the additional step is removed, and you can now interact with notifications as originally intended', 'The ‘notch’ is where all the Face ID bits are housed', 'Face ID isn’t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint scanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn’t a problem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a shrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn’t close enough to my face. If you’re the type of person who tries to sneak a look at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you’re out of luck.', 'Apps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically be replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course use it for Apple Pay payments too.', 'iPhone X – Screen', 'The iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel for the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have been using this technology for some time now, and it’s nice to see Apple finally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is also the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436 x 1125 pixels, plus there’s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby Vision HDR.', 'OLEDs offer better contrast, true blacks and a more colourful picture, but they’re not always perfect. The LG panels used by Google in the Pixel 2 XL have come in for plenty of criticism for poor viewing angles and an odd blue tinge. Even the excellent screen on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is prone to suffering poor viewing angles.', 'Apple’s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there’s a small shift to blue if you tilt the device off-axis, it’s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL. Apple says it’s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company’s optimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung’s approach for its own Galaxy S8 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the saturation isn’t quite so intense.', 'At last......', 'The Good A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine.', 'The Bad New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone Plus models.', 'The Bottom Line iPhone X is an overdue and winning evolution of the iPhone, but you’ll need to leave your comfort zone to make a jump into the face-recognizing future.', 'If you find this helpful vote helpful button.']]"
